## Installation <a name="installation"></a>
This code only includes Numpy, Pandas, matplotlib, and collections. These are all available from Anaconda, and was run on Python 3.



## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>
As a Canadian passionate about tech and economic development I often follow some of the 'Value Prop' claims used by Canada's FDI organization (Invest in Canada)[https://www.investcanada.ca/]. For this project I evaluated claims that Canada's tech workforce is more experienced, and more educated than its global peers. This was done specifically by comparing mean age, years coding, and compensation between the Canadian subset of survey responses, followed by level of education. An analysis of developer types was also conducted to better understand the specializations prevalent in Canada's developer communities.  


## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>
